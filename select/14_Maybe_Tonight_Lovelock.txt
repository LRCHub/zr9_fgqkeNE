Maybe tonight
We'll be alone at last
I know you've wanted this for
So very long

And maybe tonight
Don't let the moment pass
We've got to move or else this
Chance will be gone

Maybe tonight
You'll find yourself in my embrace

Maybe tonight
Just let the music set the pace

Maybe tonight
All your dreams will come true

Maybe tonight
When I'm lying with you

Maybe tonight

Maybe tonight

Maybe tonight
