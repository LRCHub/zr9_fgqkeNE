First it was getting a kick out of daydreaming in class
But woken up by the fact that I've yet managed to pass
Then it was I'll be missed for my charms and my paperwork
That I was an elite at filing, still looking at my shirt

Oh but one day
I'll show them what I've got
On that one day
I'll give them sorry thoughts
Just not today
But maybe some other time

I complain I'm sick, unemployed, not ready for a job
Kids are too annoying to teach, not smart enough for law
Mom said if I don't get out, won't get married soon enough
Men don't like cellulite and TV meals cannot give them love

Oh but one day
I'll show them what I've got
On that one day
I'll give them sorry thoughts
Just not today
But maybe some other time

Oh guns fire in time
I'm in costume fighting crime
I hope this never ends
I'm dreaming again
Wouldn't it be nice
Saving worlds before it's five?
Not wondering where I'll be
Just watching TV, just me and my TV

Oh but one day
I'll show them what I've got
On that one day
I'll give them sorry thoughts
Just not today
But maybe some other time
