[00:11.02] As I look over this beautiful land, I can't help but realize
[00:14.85] That I am alone
[00:22.35] 
[00:18.45] Why am I able to waste my energy
[00:21.78] To notice life being so beautiful
[00:26.07] Maybe partying will help
[00:38.07] 
[00:39.36] What of the people who don't have what I ain't got?
[00:42.87] Are they victims of my leisure?
[00:58.37] 
[00:47.06] To fail is to be a victim
[00:50.12] To be a victim of my choice
[00:54.01] Maybe partying will help
