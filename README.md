# Knoll Music – Maybe

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Underneath the starlit sky
I wonder where you are tonigh
Maybe you're thinking of me too
As I dream away, lost in
thoughts of you
Every moment feels like a chance
To find a way to our romance
In the silence, I hear your name
Maybe we'll never be the same
Maybe, just maybe
we'll find our way
Through the night into the day
With every whisper, every sigh
Maybe we'll never say goodbye
In the shadows of the moon
I hum a familiar tune
Maybe you'll hear
it in the breeze
Carrying my heart with ease
The world is wide
but love is near
In every hope, in every tear
Maybe we'll meet
where dreams align
In a place where
hearts entwine
Maybe, just maybe
we'll find our way
Through the night into the day
With every whisper, every sigh
Maybe we'll never say goodbye
The world, just maybe
we'll find our way
Through the night into the day
With every whisper, every sigh
Maybe we'll never say goodbye
Maybe, just maybe
we'll find our way
Through the night into the day
With every whisper, every sigh
Maybe we'll never say goodbye
So I'll wait beneath the stars
No matter where you are
Maybe tonight, maybe soon
We'll dance together
under the moon
